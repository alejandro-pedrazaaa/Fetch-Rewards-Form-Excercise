## What is this webpage?

This webpage contains a user creation form and the aesthetics are inspired by [Fetch Rewards](https://www.fetchrewards.com/). The form checks if the user information that the user provided is correct. If the information is not, the user is prompted to check what fields are incorrect and fix them. Once all of the fields have valid information, the user is notified and the information is "sent" as an object to the API. The webpage is also responsive.
